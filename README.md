## ✨ Key Features

### 🕵️‍♂️ Admin Surveillance HUD (God-Eye Mode)

SalesForce Nexus gives administrators a complete organizational overview through an advanced surveillance dashboard.

Admins can use **Neural Link** to directly view any agent’s personal terminal and active workspace in real time, without screen sharing or interrupting workflows.

A **Workload Monitor** displays real-time visual charts showing how leads are distributed across agents, helping prevent overload and improve assignment decisions.

The **Activity Stream** logs every system and user action in a live “Latest Updates” feed, clearly showing who changed what and when, ensuring full transparency and accountability.

### ⌨️ Command Deck (Keyboard HUD)

Inspired by terminal-based workflows, the Command Deck allows users to control the entire CRM without touching the mouse. It can be accessed using **Ctrl + K** or via the profile menu.

Users can instantly navigate between Dashboard, Pipeline, and Contacts, execute system actions like secure logout or data refresh, and experience an adaptive HUD that changes based on role.

Admins see system-wide commands and agent access tools, while agents get a focused, productivity-driven interface.

---

### 📊 Professional Pipeline & Contacts Management

SalesForce Nexus includes a visually rich sales pipeline that tracks deals from **New** to **Closed Won** with real-time distribution and funnel clarity.

Each lead has a detailed **Lead Dossier** containing complete information along with one-click communication options for WhatsApp, Email, and Calls.

The entire system is wrapped in a **dark-first Glassmorphism UI**, designed for clarity, reduced eye strain, and long sessions of focused work.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

The frontend is built using **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS**, delivering a fast, responsive, and visually polished interface.

Sales analytics and distributions are powered by **Recharts**, enabling clean and meaningful data visualization.

The backend is developed using **Node.js and Express.js**, exposing a robust REST API architecture.  
**MongoDB with Mongoose** is used for flexible and scalable data storage.

Security is handled using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** combined with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure strict authorization and protected routing.

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

The project can be run locally by cloning the repository and installing the required Node.js dependencies. Environment variables such as the MongoDB connection string and JWT secret must be configured using a `.env` file or your deployment platform’s environment settings.

Once started, the application runs with a dedicated frontend and backend, ready for development or production deployment.

For security reasons, sensitive environment files are excluded from version control, and an `.env.example` file can be used as a reference.
